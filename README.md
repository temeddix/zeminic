# About This Repository

This project is an attempt to create an open webtoon platform where creators can share their works and gain popularity from the crowd.

This repository is just a small toy project, which means various keys hardcoded in the files in this repository are not valid anymore. In real development, you should NEVER include keys like this. Also, the commit messages here are written in our mother language Korean, which would not be ideal for a serious collaborative project.
